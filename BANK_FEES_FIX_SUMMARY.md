# Bank Fees Exclusion - Critical Fix Summary

## 🎯 Problem

Your dashboard was showing **₹1.44 LAKH spending** when actual spending was only **₹24,308**.

**Why?** Bank fees and finance charges were being counted as customer spending!

## 🔍 What We Found

Testing with your HSBC statement revealed:
- **Finance charges: ₹1,16,816** → Categorized as "other_offline_spends" ❌
- **GST on interest: ₹3,026** → Also counted as spending ❌
- **Result: 83% inflation** of total spending
- **"Other Offline" showed 83.1%** because it was full of bank fees

## ✅ Solution

### 1. Updated LLM Prompt
Added **explicit exclusion rules** as the #1 critical instruction:
- Exclude finance charges, interest, late fees
- Exclude annual fees, membership fees, and their GST
- Exclude GST/IGST/CGST/SGST on ANY charges
- Exclude cashback credits, reward credits, fee reversals

### 2. Added Post-Processing Filter
Because LLMs can be inconsistent, we added a **safety net** that filters out any fees the LLM missed:

```typescript
const excludePatterns = [
  /fin.*chg/i, /finance.*charge/i, /interest/i, /late.*fee/i,
  /annual.*fee/i, /membership.*fee/i, /gst/i, /igst/i, /cgst/i, /sgst/i,
  /assessment/i, /tax.*on/i, /service.*charge/i, /processing.*fee/i,
  /cashback/i, /reward/i, /reversal/i, /refund.*fee/i, /over.*limit/i
];
```

## 📊 Results (Real HSBC Statement)

| Metric | Before Fix | After Fix | Change |
|--------|------------|-----------|--------|
| **Total Spending** | ₹1,44,153 | ₹24,308 | **-83%** ✅ |
| **Transactions** | 22 | 17 | 5 fees removed |
| **Other Offline %** | 83.1% | 0% | **Fixed!** |
| **Groceries %** | 14.5% | 86.1% | Accurate ✅ |
| **Food Delivery %** | 2.1% | 12.3% | Accurate ✅ |

## 🎉 What This Means

1. **Accurate dashboard totals** - No more inflated spending
2. **Correct category distribution** - Groceries show as 86%, not "Other Offline" at 83%
3. **Trustworthy optimizer** - Recommendations based on real spending, not bank fees
4. **Better insights** - See where you actually spend, not what the bank charges

## 🛠️ Files Updated

1. ✅ `src/app/api/gmail/process-statements-v2/route.ts` - Production API
2. ✅ `scripts/test-prompt-single-statement.js` - Test script
3. ✅ `scripts/extract-text.js` - Text extraction support
4. ✅ `PROMPT_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Full documentation

## 🧪 How to Test

```powershell
# Set your OpenAI API key
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Test with a single statement (fast!)
node scripts/test-prompt-single-statement.js "statement.pdf" "password" "bankcode"

# Example with your HSBC statement
node scripts/test-prompt-single-statement.js "20251008.pdf" "151085404400" "hsbc"
```

**What to check:**
- ✅ Total spending is reasonable (not lakhs)
- ✅ No finance charges in transactions list
- ✅ "Other Offline" is low (< 20%)
- ✅ Categories match your actual spending patterns

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Clear old data**: `localStorage.removeItem('cardgenius_statements')`
2. **Re-sync Gmail** to process all statements with the new logic
3. **Check dashboard** - Numbers should look much more realistic!
4. **Verify optimizer** - Recommendations will now be based on accurate spending

## 💡 Key Takeaway

**Before:** Dashboard showed you "spent" ₹1.44 LAKH, with 83% in "Other Offline"  
**After:** Dashboard shows you spent ₹24,308, with 86% on groceries (Blinkit/Zepto)

**The difference?** Finance charges (₹1.19 LAKH) are now correctly excluded! 🎯
