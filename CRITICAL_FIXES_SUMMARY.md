# Critical Fixes Applied - Must Restart Server!

## Two Major Bugs Fixed

### Bug #1: Email Body Not Included in Results ‚úÖ
**File:** `src/lib/gmail/client.ts` (Line 256)

**Problem:** Email bodies were being fetched but dropped before returning results, so password hint analysis received `undefined`.

**Fix:** Added `emailBody: latest.emailBody` to the results object.

**Impact:** `passwordRequirement` will now be populated instead of always being `null`.

### Bug #2: PDF Password Decryption Broken ‚úÖ
**File:** `src/lib/parser-llm/core/pdf-extractor.ts` (Lines 28-87)

**Problem:** `pdf-parse` doesn't handle encrypted PDFs - it tries to read test files from disk when given a password.

**Fix:** Use `pdf-lib` to decrypt password-protected PDFs first, THEN pass the decrypted buffer to `pdf-parse` for text extraction.

**Code Flow:**
```typescript
1. If password provided ‚Üí Use pdf-lib to decrypt
2. Save decrypted PDF to buffer
3. Pass decrypted buffer to pdf-parse
4. Extract text successfully
```

**Impact:** Password-protected PDFs will now actually decrypt instead of throwing file-not-found errors.

## üö® CRITICAL: You MUST Restart the Server! üö®

The server is still running **old code** from before these fixes.

### Steps to Restart:

1. **Stop the server:**
   - Find the PowerShell window running `npm run dev`
   - Press `Ctrl+C` to stop it

2. **Restart in Command Prompt (recommended for Windows):**
   ```cmd
   cd "c:\Users\Mohsin\Downloads\Cursor 28 - CG Incognito"
   npm run dev
   ```

   **OR in PowerShell** (run commands separately):
   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Users\Mohsin\Downloads\Cursor 28 - CG Incognito"
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Wait for:** `Ready on http://localhost:3000`

4. **Test again:** Go to `/gmail-test` and click "Test Sync"

## What You Should See After Restart

### 1. Email Hint Extraction Working:
```
Console logs:
üîç Analyzing password hint for hdfc
üìß Email body length: 1234 characters
üìß Email body preview: Dear Customer, Your credit card statement...
‚úÖ Password analysis for hdfc: DDMMYYYY + last 4 digits (high)
```

### 2. Password Requirements Populated:
```json
{
  "passwordRequirement": {
    "fields": ["dob", "card_last4"],
    "format": "DDMMYYYY + last 4 digits",
    "instructions": "Use your date of birth (DDMMYYYY) and last 4 digits of card",
    "confidence": "high",
    "source": "regex"
  }
}
```

### 3. PDF Decryption Working:
```
Console logs:
üîë Attempt 1/22: 15101985 (dob-full)
ü§ñ Trying LLM parser with password: "15101985" (dob-full)
üìÑ Extracting text from PDF...
üîì Successfully decrypted PDF with password: "15101985"
‚úÖ PDF parsed successfully
```

## Why Restarting is Critical

**Next.js dev server caches compiled code.** Your changes to:
- `src/lib/gmail/client.ts`
- `src/lib/parser-llm/core/pdf-extractor.ts`

...are saved to disk but the server is still executing the **old compiled versions** from memory.

A full restart forces Next.js to:
1. Re-read all source files
2. Re-compile TypeScript
3. Load new code into memory

## Testing Checklist

After restart:

- [ ] Console shows "Ready on http://localhost:3000"
- [ ] Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/gmail-test`
- [ ] Click "Test Sync"
- [ ] Check console for email body extraction logs
- [ ] Verify `passwordRequirement` is NOT `null` in response
- [ ] Select statements and click "Process Selected"
- [ ] Check console for successful PDF decryption logs
- [ ] At least 1 statement should parse successfully (if passwords match)

## Common Issues

### If you still see `passwordRequirement: null`:
- Server didn't restart fully - try stopping and starting again
- Clear browser cache: Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh)

### If you still see file-not-found errors:
- Server didn't pick up the pdf-extractor changes
- Make sure you're in the correct directory before running `npm run dev`
- Check that `src/lib/parser-llm/core/pdf-extractor.ts` contains `pdf-lib` import

### If PowerShell gives `&&` errors:
- Use Command Prompt instead (cmd.exe)
- Or run commands separately in PowerShell (one line at a time)
