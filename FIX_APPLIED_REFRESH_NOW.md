# âœ… FIX APPLIED - Just Refresh!

## What I Fixed (Just Now)

**Fixed `monthly-spend-summary.tsx`** - The dashboard component was recalculating totals using the OLD buggy logic!

That's why even after clearing localStorage and re-running sync, you still saw â‚¹34.13 lakh.

## What You Need to Do

### **Option 1: Just Refresh** (If Next.js Hot Reload Works)
1. **Hard refresh your browser:** `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. Check dashboard - should now show correct totals

### **Option 2: Full Restart** (If Refresh Doesn't Work)
1. **Stop Next.js server** in terminal: `Ctrl+C`
2. **Start it again:** `npm run dev`
3. **Wait for:** "Ready on http://localhost:3000"
4. **Refresh browser:** `Ctrl+Shift+R`

## What to Expect

Your **existing data in localStorage is fine**! The dashboard just needs to recalculate using the fixed logic.

You should see:
- **IDFC: ~â‚¹1.7 lakh** (was showing â‚¹6.3 lakh)
- **HDFC: Still need to check** (â‚¹25 lakh seems high even for debits)
- **AXIS: ~â‚¹1.2 lakh** (looks correct)

## Why It Happened

I fixed the `totalAmount` calculation in `gmail-test/page.tsx` (where statements are **saved** to localStorage).

But I **forgot** about `monthly-spend-summary.tsx` which **recalculates** totals when displaying the dashboard!

## Both Places Now Fixed

âœ… `src/app/gmail-test/page.tsx` (saves to localStorage)
âœ… `src/components/monthly-spend-summary.tsx` (displays on dashboard)

**Just refresh your browser and check!** ðŸš€
