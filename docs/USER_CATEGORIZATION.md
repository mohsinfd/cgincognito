# User-Assisted Categorization Guide

## Overview

CardGenius uses a **smart categorization system** that combines automated mapping with user assistance for ambiguous transactions.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Step 1: Auto-Categorization with Confidence Scoring

When a statement is uploaded, each transaction is analyzed:

```typescript
Transaction: "SWIGGY INSTAMART"
→ Confidence: HIGH ✅
→ Category: grocery_spends_online
→ Needs Review: NO

Transaction: "XYZ STORE MUMBAI"
→ Confidence: LOW ⚠️
→ Category: other_offline_spends
→ Needs Review: YES
```

### Step 2: Show Summary

After parsing, users see:

```
✅ Auto-categorized: 34 transactions
⚠️  Need your help: 6 transactions

[Review Now (6)] [Skip for now]
```

### Step 3: Review Flow (Optional)

If user clicks "Review Now", they see one transaction at a time:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ XYZ STORE MUMBAI                    │
│ 15 Sep 2025           ₹1,250        │
│                                     │
│ 💡 Our suggestion: Other Offline    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Select category:
[📦 Amazon]  [🛍️ Flipkart]  [🛒 Grocery]
[🍽️ Dining]  [⛽ Fuel]      [✈️ Travel]
[💡 Utilities] [🎓 Education] [🏠 Rent]

[Keep Suggestion] [← Back]

Progress: 1 of 6 ████░░░░░░
```

### Step 4: Learning & Improvement

User corrections are saved and can be used to:
1. Update regex rules
2. Train ML models
3. Improve future auto-categorization

## 📊 Confidence Levels

### High Confidence (90%+ accuracy) ✅
**No review needed**

Patterns:
- Clear brand names: SWIGGY, ZOMATO, AMAZON, FLIPKART
- Specific merchants: HPCL, IOCL, INDIGO AIRLINES
- Online grocers: BLINKIT, INSTAMART, BIGBASKET

Examples:
```
"SWIGGY BANGALORE" → dining_or_going_out (HIGH)
"AMAZON PAYMENTS" → amazon_spends (HIGH)
"IOCL PETROL PUMP" → fuel (HIGH)
```

### Medium Confidence (70-85%) ⚠️
**May need review**

Patterns:
- Generic categories: RESTAURANT, CAFE, SUPERMARKET
- Partial matches: HOTEL, BILL PAYMENT

Examples:
```
"ABC RESTAURANT DELHI" → dining_or_going_out (MEDIUM)
"CITY SUPERMARKET" → other_offline_spends (MEDIUM)
```

### Low Confidence (<70%) ⚠️
**Definitely needs review**

Patterns:
- Wallet payments: PAYTM, PHONEPE, GPAY
- Generic descriptions: POS, MERCHANT PAYMENT
- Short names: "XYZ", "ABC STORE"

Examples:
```
"PAYTM MERCHANT" → other_offline_spends (LOW)
"POS TRANSACTION" → other_offline_spends (LOW)
"ABC" → other_offline_spends (LOW)
```

## 🎨 UX Flow

### Scenario 1: All High Confidence

```
Upload → Parse → ✅ "All 45 transactions categorized!"
→ Show results immediately
```

### Scenario 2: Some Need Review

```
Upload → Parse → ⚠️ "34 auto-categorized, 6 need your help"
→ Show banner with [Review Now] button
→ User can review or skip
→ Show results
```

### Scenario 3: Many Need Review

```
Upload → Parse → ⚠️ "15 transactions need review"
→ Automatically start review flow
→ User categorizes one by one
→ Can skip remaining if tired
→ Show results with updated categories
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Files Created
- `src/lib/mapper/smart-mapper.ts` - Confidence scoring logic
- `src/components/category-review.tsx` - Review UI component
- `src/components/results-view.tsx` - Updated with review flow

### Key Functions

```typescript
// Categorize with confidence
categorizeSmart(vendorCat, description, amount)
→ { bucket, confidence, needsReview, reason }

// Get transactions needing review
getTransactionsNeedingReview(transactions)
→ [index1, index2, ...]

// Get confidence statistics
getCategoryStats(transactions)
→ { high: 34, medium: 8, low: 3, needsReview: 11 }
```

| SBI 30 txns | 27 (90%) | 3 (10%) | 98%+ after review |
| ICICI 45 txns | 38 (84%) | 7 (16%) | 96%+ after review |
