# Browser Storage PoC Implementation

## Overview

CardGenius uses **browser localStorage** for the PoC. No backend database needed! Data stays on the user's device for privacy and simplicity.

---

## ✅ What's Implemented

### 1. **Auto-Save After Upload**
When a statement is parsed successfully:
```
Upload → Parse → ✅ Auto-saved to browser
```

User sees:
```
✅ Statement saved! You can view it anytime in My Statements
```

### 2. **My Statements Page**
`/statements`

Shows:
- List of all saved statements
- Bank, card last 4, transaction count
- Upload date
- Total dues
- Click to view details or delete

### 3. **Statement Detail Page**
`/statements/[id]`

Shows:
- Full statement summary
- All transactions in table format
- Card details and credit info

### 4. **Storage Management**
- Automatic storage (no user action needed)
- Limit: 10 statements max (prevents overflow)
- Warning when approaching limit
- One-click delete per statement
- View storage usage

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### Storage Layer
`src/lib/storage/browser-storage.ts`

```typescript
// Save statement (called automatically after parsing)
saveStatement(statementId, bankCode, content);

// Get all statements
const statements = getStatements();

// Get specific statement
const statement = getStatement(id);

// Delete statement
deleteStatement(id);

// Delete all
deleteAllStatements();
```

### Data Structure
```typescript
{
  id: "stmt_123",
  uploadedAt: "2025-09-30T10:30:00Z",
  bankCode: "hdfc",
  cardLast4: "1234",
  totalAmount: 5000,
  transactionCount: 45,
  content: {
    // Full BoostScore response
  }
}
```

### Storage Limits
- **localStorage max**: ~5-10MB (browser dependent)
- **Limit**: 10 statements max
- **Average statement**: ~100-200KB
- **Total capacity**: ~1-2MB used

## 🎯 User Flow

### First Time Upload
```
1. User uploads statement
2. ✅ Auto-saved to browser
3. See "Statement saved!" message
4. Click "View My Statements"
5. See statement in list
```

### Returning User
```
1. User opens app
2. Clicks "📁 My Statements"
3. Sees all previously uploaded statements
4. Clicks any statement to view details
5. Can upload more or delete old ones
```

### Storage Full
```
User has 10 statements
    ↓
Upload 11th statement
    ↓
⚠️ Warning: "Approaching storage limit"
    ↓
Delete old statements to make room
```

## 📊 Pages Created

### 1. Home Page (`/`)
- Added "📁 My Statements" button (top right)
- Links to statements list

### 2. Statements List (`/statements`)
- Shows all saved statements
- Grid/card layout
- Delete buttons
- Storage info banner
- Empty state for new users

### 3. Statement Detail (`/statements/[id]`)
- Full statement view
- Summary cards
- Transaction table
- Back navigation

### 4. Results View (Updated)
- Auto-saves after parsing
- Shows success banner
- "View My Statements" button
- "Upload Another" button

## 🎨 UI Features

### Info Banners
```
ℹ️ PoC Mode: Your statements are stored in your browser 
(not on a server). They'll persist between sessions but 
won't sync across devices.
```

### Success Messages
```
✅ Statement saved! You can view it anytime in My Statements
```

### Warning Messages
```
⚠️ You're approaching the storage limit (9/10 statements). 
Consider deleting old statements to make room for new ones.
```

### Empty State
```
📄
No statements yet
Upload your first credit card statement to get started

[Upload Statement]
```

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### ✅ Advantages
1. **Data never leaves device** - No server uploads
2. **No user accounts needed** - Anonymous usage
3. **Instant deletion** - Clear browser data = all gone
4. **No privacy policy concerns** - We literally don't see the data
5. **GDPR compliant by default** - Data processing on device

### ⚠️ Limitations
1. **Browser-specific** - Data doesn't sync across devices
2. **Fragile** - Clearing browser data deletes everything
3. **No backup** - If lost, it's gone
4. **Limited storage** - ~10 statements max

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Fresh User
```bash
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Upload Statement"
3. Upload a PDF
4. After parsing, see "Statement saved!" message
5. Click "View My Statements"
6. Should see 1 statement in list
7. Click statement to view details
```

### Test Scenario 2: Multiple Uploads
```bash
1. Upload 3 different statements
2. Go to /statements
3. Should see 3 statements listed
4. Each should show bank, card, date
5. Click each to verify details load
```

### Test Scenario 3: Delete
```bash
1. Go to /statements
2. Click "Delete" on a statement
3. Confirm deletion
4. Statement should disappear
5. Reload page - still gone
```

### Test Scenario 4: Persistence
```bash
1. Upload a statement
2. Close browser completely
3. Reopen and go to /statements
4. Statement should still be there
```

### Test Scenario 5: Storage Limit
```bash
1. Upload 9 statements
2. Should see warning: "Approaching limit (9/10)"
3. Upload 10th statement
4. Try to upload 11th
5. Oldest should be removed automatically (FIFO)
```

## 🚀 Upgrade Path to Database

When you're ready for production, migration is easy:

### Keep Same API
```typescript
// Browser storage (PoC)
import { getStatements } from '@/lib/storage/browser-storage';

// Database (Production) - same interface!
import { getStatements } from '@/lib/storage/database';
```

### Migration Strategy
1. Create database layer with same interface
2. Add feature flag: `USE_DATABASE=true/false`
3. Switch implementation based on flag
4. Gradual rollout

### What Changes
- ✅ Data syncs across devices
- ✅ Unlimited storage
- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ User accounts
- ⚠️ Need backend infrastructure
- ⚠️ Privacy/security considerations

## 💡 Tips for PoC Demos

### For Investors
```
"Our PoC runs entirely in your browser - no data ever 
leaves your device. This is perfect for sensitive 
financial data demos."
```

### For Users
```
"Try it risk-free - your statements are stored locally 
on your device. We never see your financial data."
```

### For Technical Stakeholders
```
"We're using localStorage for PoC to validate product-market 
fit before investing in backend infrastructure. Easy to 
upgrade to Supabase/Postgres when ready."
```

## 📈 Metrics You Can Track (Without Database!)

Even with browser storage:

```typescript
// Track in localStorage
const metrics = {
  totalUploads: 0,
  lastUploadDate: null,
  averageTransactions: 0,
  mostUsedBank: null,
};

// Increment on each upload
metrics.totalUploads++;
localStorage.setItem('metrics', JSON.stringify(metrics));
```

Show user:
```
📊 Your Stats
- 5 statements uploaded
- 230 transactions analyzed
- Last upload: Yesterday
```
