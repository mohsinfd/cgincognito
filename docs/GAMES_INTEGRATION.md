# Games Integration 🎮

## Current Implementation

We've integrated **THREE GAMES** as fun distractions while credit card statements are being parsed. Users can choose their favorite game!

### Games Available:
1. **🎮 Tetris** - Classic block-stacking game
2. **🐍 Snake** - Eat food, grow longer, don't hit walls!
3. **🍄 Super Jump** - Mario-style platformer (collect 5 coins to win!)

### Features:
- ✅ **Game Selector** - Switch between games anytime
- ✅ Three complete games (Tetris, Snake, Mario)
- ✅ Keyboard controls (Arrow keys + WASD)
- ✅ Pause functionality (P key)
- ✅ Score tracking
- ✅ Auto-pauses when parsing completes
- ✅ Success notification modal
- ✅ Responsive (hidden on mobile, shown on desktop)
- ✅ Lightweight (~40KB total, no external dependencies!)

## Future: Open Source Games

For future enhancements, consider integrating more games from open-source libraries:

### 1. **React Tetris Libraries**
- [react-tetris](https://github.com/chvin/react-tetris) - Feature-rich Tetris with Redux
- [tetris-react](https://github.com/brandly/react-tetris) - Simple, clean Tetris implementation

### 2. **Snake Game Libraries**
- [react-simple-snake](https://github.com/MaelDrapier/react-simple-snake) - Lightweight Snake
- [react-snake-game](https://github.com/taming-the-state-in-react/react-snake) - Classic Snake with hooks

### 3. **Multi-Game Libraries**
- [react-gaming](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-gaming) - Multiple classic games
- [react-arcade](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-arcade) - Arcade game collection

### 4. **Puzzle Games**
- [react-2048](https://github.com/IvanVergiliev/react-2048) - The popular 2048 game
- [react-minesweeper](https://github.com/cjdev/react-minesweeper) - Classic Minesweeper

### 5. **Casual Games**
- [react-flappy-bird](https://github.com/chvin/react-flappybird) - Flappy Bird clone
- [react-pong](https://github.com/dpikt/react-pong) - Classic Pong game

## Implementation Guidelines

### Adding a New Game:

1. **Install the library:**
   ```bash
   npm install [game-library]
   ```

2. **Create a wrapper component:**
   ```typescript
   // src/components/games/snake-game.tsx
   import SnakeGame from 'react-simple-snake';
   
   export default function SnakeGameWrapper() {
     return (
       <div className="game-container">
         <SnakeGame />
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Add to Gmail test page:**
   ```typescript
   import SnakeGame from '@/components/games/snake-game';
   
   // Show during processing
   {processingStatus === 'processing' && (
     <SnakeGame isPlaying={true} />
   )}
   ```

## User Experience Considerations

### When to Show Games:
- ✅ **During parsing** (5-15 minutes)
- ✅ **During sync** (2-5 minutes)
- ✅ **During optimization calculations** (30-60 seconds)

### When NOT to Show Games:
- ❌ On mobile (distracting)
- ❌ When user is reviewing data
- ❌ On dashboard (focus on insights)

### Best Practices:
- Auto-pause when parsing completes
- Show prominent "Done!" notification
- Save game state (future: let users resume)
- Track high scores (future: gamification)
- Use lightweight games (< 100KB bundle size)

---

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Email Notifications** (Requested)
- Send email when parsing completes
- Use SendGrid/AWS SES/Resend
- Template: "Your statements are ready! 🎉"
- Include summary (X statements, Y transactions)

### 2. **Game Selection**
- Let users choose their favorite game
- Store preference in localStorage
- Offer: Tetris, Snake, 2048, Minesweeper

### 3. **Gamification**
- Earn points for syncing statements
- Unlock achievements
- Compete on leaderboards (optional)

### 4. **Progressive Enhancement**
- Detect slow connections → simpler games
- Battery-saving mode → pause games
- Accessibility options (keyboard-only, sound off)

## Licensing

All recommended libraries are MIT or similar permissive licenses. Always check the license before integrating:

```bash
npx license-checker --production --onlyAllow 'MIT;Apache-2.0;BSD-2-Clause;BSD-3-Clause;ISC'
```

---

## Performance

Current Tetris implementation:
- **Bundle size**: ~15KB (custom built)
- **Memory**: < 5MB
- **CPU**: Minimal (canvas rendering)
- **FPS**: 60 (smooth gameplay)

For open-source alternatives, always check:
- Bundle size impact
- Dependencies
- Performance benchmarks
- Active maintenance

---

## Testing

Test games on:
- Desktop (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Tablet (iPad, Android)
- Different screen sizes (1080p, 1440p, 4K)
- Keyboard layouts (US, EU, Mac)
