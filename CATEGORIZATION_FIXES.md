# Categorization Fixes Applied

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

Based on your diagnostic results, I fixed 3 major categorization issues:

---

## Fix #1: Swiggy/Bundl Technologies

### Before ❌
```
BUNDL TECHNOLOGIES (www.swiggy.in)
Category: E_COMMERCE
Mapped to: other_online_spends
```

### After ✅
```
BUNDL TECHNOLOGIES (www.swiggy.in)
Category: E_COMMERCE
Mapped to: dining_or_going_out
```

### What Changed:
- Added `bundl technologies` to dining patterns
- Enhanced E_COMMERCE mapper to check for food delivery keywords
- Now correctly identifies Swiggy even when marked as E_COMMERCE

---

## Fix #2: Foreign Currency Fees

### Before ❌
```
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION FEE: ₹171.59
Status: Included in spending
Category: other_offline_spends
```

### After ✅
```
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION FEE: ₹171.59
Status: Excluded
Reason: Forex Fees
```

### What Changed:
- Added forex fee detection
- Filters out: "FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION FEE", "FOREX FEE", "FX FEE"
- Also filters: "DCC MARKUP" charges
- These are now excluded from spending analysis

**Impact**: Your ₹1,000+ in forex fees won't inflate your spending numbers

## Fix #3: International Merchants

### Before ❌
```
CAREEM (UAE ride-sharing) → other_offline_spends
EMIRATES (Airline) → other_offline_spends
TALABAT (UAE food delivery) → other_offline_spends
```

### After ✅
```
CAREEM → travel (ride-sharing)
EMIRATES → travel (airline)
TALABAT → dining_or_going_out (food delivery)
DUBAI DUTY FREE → travel (airport shopping)
TAXI → travel
```

### What Changed:
- Added international patterns: CAREEM, EMIRATES, TALABAT
- Added TAXI pattern for generic taxi services
- Airport duty free now maps to travel
- SHOPPING category added (malls, arena)
