## 📝 How to Use This for Debugging

### **Step 1: Watch Terminal During Processing**

When you process statements, **keep terminal open** and watch for:

1. **LLM parsing results** - Are transactions being extracted correctly?
2. **Categories assigned** - Is the LLM categorizing correctly?
3. **Filtered transactions** - Are fees being caught?

**Example validation:**
```
✅ GOOD:
- "Blinkit BANGALORE" → grocery_spends_online
- "SWIGGY BANGALORE" → online_food_ordering
- "VODAFONE IDEA" → mobile_phone_bills

❌ BAD:
- "Blinkit BANGALORE" → other_offline_spends  (wrong!)
- "SWIGGY" → other_online_spends  (should be food_ordering!)
```

### **Step 2: Check Console Category Breakdown**

After processing, look at the category summary:

```
✅ GOOD Breakdown:
  • grocery_spends_online: 12 transactions  ← Makes sense
  • online_food_ordering: 3 transactions    ← Reasonable
  • mobile_phone_bills: 1 transactions      ← Expected

❌ BAD Breakdown:
  • other_offline_spends: 45 transactions   ← Too high!
  • online_food_ordering: 1 transactions    ← Too low!
```

### **Step 3: Review on Statements Page**

1. Go to `/statements`
2. Click on any statement
3. Review:
   - **Category Summary** - Are the totals reasonable?
   - **Transaction Table** - Check individual categorizations

**What to look for:**
- ✅ Groceries (Blinkit, Zepto) → `grocery_spends_online`
- ✅ Food delivery (Swiggy, Zomato) → `online_food_ordering`
- ✅ Utility bills → `mobile_phone_bills`, `electricity_bills`
- ❌ Generic transactions → `other_offline_spends` (should be low!)

## 🐛 Debugging Checklist

Use this to validate LLM performance:

### **✅ Terminal Validation:**
- [ ] All expected transactions extracted?
- [ ] Finance charges filtered out?
- [ ] Categories look reasonable?
- [ ] Dr/Cr classification correct?

### **✅ Category Distribution:**
- [ ] "Other Offline" < 20%?
- [ ] Top categories match your spending?
- [ ] Grocery/food delivery recognized?
- [ ] Utilities categorized correctly?

### **✅ Individual Transaction Check:**
- [ ] Merchant names clean (no "POS*", "REF*")?
- [ ] Amounts positive?
- [ ] Dates in YYYY-MM-DD format?
- [ ] Categories match merchant type?

## 📊 Example Terminal Output (From Your Logs)

From your test, here's what you should see:

```
📄 V2 Processing hdfc: 5522XXXXXXXXXX59_14-10-2025_588.pdf
✅ Decryption successful with password: "MOHS1510"
📄 Text extracted: 5351 characters

📋 LLM PARSING RESULTS (2 transactions):
================================================================================
1. [Dr] 2025-10-14 | Some Transaction
   Amount: ₹1000 | Category: grocery_spends_online

2. [Dr] 2025-10-14 | IGST-VPS
   Amount: ₹1745.44 | Category: other_offline_spends
================================================================================

   ⚠️  Filtered out fee/charge: "IGST-VPS" (₹1745.44)
   📝 Post-processing filtered 1 fee/charge transactions

✅ FINAL TRANSACTIONS KEPT (1):
1. [Dr] ₹1000 - Some Transaction → grocery_spends_online

🤖 Parsed successfully: 1 transactions
✅ V2 Successfully processed hdfc with password: MOHS1510
```

**Key observations:**
- ✅ LLM initially extracted 2 transactions
- ✅ Post-processing filtered out "IGST-VPS" (bank fee)
- ✅ Final result: 1 valid spending transaction

## 🎯 What This Solves

**Before:**
- ❌ No visibility into LLM parsing
- ❌ Can't validate categorizations
- ❌ Hard to debug incorrect totals
- ❌ No way to check individual transactions

**After:**
- ✅ Full terminal logging of parsing
- ✅ Category breakdown per statement
- ✅ Visual UI to review transactions
- ✅ Can validate each transaction's category
- ✅ Easy to spot miscategorizations

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Process statements and watch terminal**
2. **Review `/statements` page** for each bank
3. **Verify categories match your expectations**
4. **If something looks wrong:**
   - Check terminal logs for that statement
   - See what category LLM assigned
   - Report specific examples for prompt tuning

## 📝 Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/app/api/gmail/process-statements-v2/route.ts`
   - Added detailed logging before/after filtering
   - Shows every transaction with category

2. ✅ `src/app/gmail-test/page.tsx`
   - Added category breakdown logging after save

3. ✅ `src/app/statements/[id]/page.tsx`

   - Enhanced transaction display

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Keep terminal visible** during processing to catch issues immediately
2. **Check statements page** after processing to validate
3. **Look for patterns** - If one merchant is miscategorized, others might be too
4. **Report specific examples** - Makes prompt tuning easier
5. **Compare across months** - See if categorization is consistent
