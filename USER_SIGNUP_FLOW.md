# User Signup Flow - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a complete user signup flow that collects name and DOB when users first connect their Gmail account to CardGenius.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Signup Form Component** (`src/components/signup-form.tsx`)
- Beautiful, modal-style signup form
- Collects:
  - **Name** (as on credit cards)
  - **Date of Birth** (DDMMYYYY format)
- Includes explanation of why we need this info:
  - Name + DOB used to decrypt PDFs from banks
  - Secure local storage (browser only)
  - Privacy notice with security badge

### 2. **Integration with Gmail OAuth Flow**
- Modified `src/app/gmail-test/page.tsx` to:
  - Check if user exists after OAuth success
  - Show signup form for first-time users
  - Automatically start Gmail sync after signup
  - Store user data in localStorage

### 3. **User Data Storage**
- Stores in `localStorage` under key `cardgenius_user`:
  ```json
  {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "name": "RAJESH KUMAR",
    "dob": "15011990",
    "createdAt": "2025-01-XX..."
  }
  ```

## User Flow

### First-Time User:
1. User clicks "Connect Gmail"
2. Grants Gmail access
3. Returns to app → **Signup form appears**
4. Enters name and DOB
5. Clicks "Complete Signup"
6. User data saved locally
7. Gmail sync starts automatically

### Returning User:
1. User clicks "Connect Gmail"
2. Grants Gmail access
3. Returns to app → **No signup form** (already exists)
4. Gmail sync starts immediately

## Why We Collect This Info

### From User's Perspective:
✅ **Name**: Matches the name on credit cards (HDFC, Axis, ICICI all use this)  
✅ **DOB**: Combined with name to unlock PDFs from most banks  
✅ **Secure**: Stored locally in browser, never sent to servers  
✅ **Purpose**: Decrypt statement PDFs with correct passwords  

### Technical Explanation:
- Banks password-protect PDFs with name + DOB combinations
- Examples:
  - HDFC: `Name+DOB`
  - Axis: `Name+DOB`
  - SBI: `DDMMYYYY+Last4digits`
  - HSBC: `DOB+Last6digits`

## Files Modified

1. **Created**: `src/components/signup-form.tsx`
   - New signup form component with validation
   - Includes privacy/security messaging

2. **Modified**: `src/app/gmail-test/page.tsx`
   - Added signup check after OAuth
   - Added signup form modal
   - Added signup handler function
   - Integrated with existing flow

## Testing

### To Test:
1. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
2. Go to `/gmail-test`
3. Click "Connect Gmail"
4. Grant access
5. Should see signup form
6. Enter name and DOB
7. Click submit
8. Should see user data in localStorage
9. Gmail sync should start automatically

### What to Verify:
- ✅ Signup form appears only for first-time users
- ✅ Form validation works (name length, DOB format)
- ✅ User data saved to localStorage
- ✅ Gmail sync starts after signup
- ✅ Returning users skip signup form

## Benefits

1. **Privacy-First**: Local storage only, no server storage
2. **Transparent**: Clear explanation of why we need info
3. **Seamless**: Auto-starts sync after signup
4. **Secure**: Data never leaves browser
5. **User-Friendly**: One-time setup, then instant access

## Next Steps

- [ ] Add DOB validation improvements
- [ ] Add "Skip for now" option (with limited functionality)
- [ ] Add user profile page to update info
- [ ] Consider encrypting localStorage data
- [ ] Add user deletion option

## Security Notes

- All data stored in browser localStorage (client-side only)
- No data sent to backend servers
- User can clear localStorage anytime
- One-click data deletion recommended for production
