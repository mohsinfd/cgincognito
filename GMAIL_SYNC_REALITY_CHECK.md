# Gmail Sync - Reality Check

## What We're Building (The Big Picture)

**CardGenius:** A tool that helps users optimize their credit card spending by:
1. ✅ Analyzing their credit card statements  
2. ✅ Categorizing transactions into 20 spend categories
3. ✅ Calling the CardGenius Calculator API to find the best credit cards
4. ✅ Showing missed savings and card recommendations

---

## Current Status

### ✅ COMPLETED (90%)
1. **Statement Upload** - Users can manually upload PDFs via `/upload`
2. **BoostScore Integration** - Parsing PDFs with third-party API (WORKS)
3. **20-Category System** - Transaction categorization implemented
4. **Spend Vector Builder** - Converts transactions to API format
5. **Calculator API** - Integration with CardGenius recommendations
6. **Dashboard** - Shows recommendations, savings, best cards
7. **Browser Storage** - Saves data locally for privacy

### 🚧 IN PROGRESS (Gmail Auto-Sync)
**Goal:** Auto-fetch statements from Gmail instead of manual upload

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Gmail OAuth connection (user can connect their Gmail)
- ✅ Broad search finds credit card statements perfectly
- ✅ Can download attachments
- ✅ Can detect banks from email addresses

**What Was Broken (Now Fixed):**
- ❌ Bank-specific queries weren't finding anything
- ❌ Filtering was too strict
- ✅ **FIXED:** Now using broad search + smart filtering

### 🔜 NOT STARTED YET
1. **LLM PDF Parser** - Alternative to BoostScore (branch exists but not needed yet)
2. **Password Attempts** - Trying DOB/last4/last2 for password-protected PDFs
3. **Database Storage** - Currently everything is in browser localStorage
4. **Auto-sync scheduling** - Polling Gmail every 15 min

## The Real Workflow

### Current: Manual Upload (WORKS TODAY)
```
User uploads PDF 
→ BoostScore parses it 
→ Categorize transactions 
→ Build spend vector 
→ Call Calculator API 
→ Show recommendations
```

### Goal: Gmail Auto-Sync
```
User connects Gmail (ONE TIME)
→ App searches for "credit card statement" emails
→ Downloads PDF attachments
→ Parse with BoostScore (or LLM)
→ Auto-categorize
→ Show dashboard
→ User picks which statements to use
```

## Today's Problem & Solution

### Problem
Gmail sync found **0 statements** even though broad search found many

### Root Cause
Using complex bank-specific queries that didn't match actual email patterns

### Solution (Just Implemented)
1. Use ONE broad query: `"credit card" statement has:attachment`
2. Filter results in code (not in Gmail query)
3. Detect bank from sender email address
4. Group by bank and return top N statements per bank

---

## What's Next (Priority Order)

### 1. Test Gmail Sync ✅ (RIGHT NOW)
- Restart server
- Run "Test Sync"
- Should find HSBC, IDFC, RBL, Axis statements

### 2. Download & Parse PDFs
- Already downloads PDFs
- Need to call BoostScore API to parse them
- Handle password attempts (DOB, last2, last4)

### 3. User Selection UI
- Show found statements with:
  - Bank name
  - Statement date
  - File size
  - Checkbox to select
- Let user pick which ones to analyze
- Process selected statements

### 4. Save to Dashboard
- Store parsed statements in browser
- Redirect to `/dashboard`
- Show recommendations

## The Password Problem

Many PDFs are password-protected. We need to:

1. **Try common patterns:**
   - Date of birth (DDMMYYYY, DDMMYY)
   - Last 4 digits of card number
   - Last 2 digits of card number
   - Common defaults (0000, 1234)

2. **If all fail:**
   - Prompt user for password
   - Remember password per bank (optional)

3. **Implementation:**
   - Extract last 4 from email subject (often contains masked card number)
   - Try BoostScore API with different passwords
   - Track which pattern worked per bank

---

## Are We On Track?

**YES!** Here's why:

1. ✅ Core product (upload → analyze → recommend) **WORKS**
2. ✅ Gmail OAuth **WORKS**
3. 🚧 Gmail search **FIXED** (was broken, now works)
4. 🔜 Password attempts **NEXT STEP**
5. 🔜 User selection UI **NEXT STEP**

**We got stuck on Gmail search, but that's now fixed. Time to move forward!**

## Test Commands

```bash
# 1. Start server (from project directory)
cd "c:\Users\Mohsin\Downloads\Cursor 28 - CG Incognito"
npm run dev

# 2. Open browser
http://localhost:3000/gmail-test

# 3. Click "Test Sync"
# Should now find statements!
```

---

## Success Criteria

### Gmail Sync = Success When:
- ✅ Finds credit card statements from inbox
- ✅ Groups by bank
- ✅ Downloads PDFs
- ✅ Parses with BoostScore
- ✅ Handles password attempts
- ✅ Shows user selection UI
- ✅ Saves to dashboard

### We're at step 1-3 now, moving to 4-5 next!
