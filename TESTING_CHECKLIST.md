  "dining_or_going_out": 2153,
  "flights_annual": 36000,            ← ×12 extrapolation
  "hotels_annual": 18000,             ← ×12 extrapolation  
  "mobile_phone_bills": 695,          ← Key fix!

## ⚠️ Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Type error" when compiling
**Solution:**
```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules\.cache
npm run dev
```

### Issue: "Module not found: complete-mapper"
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Files might not be saved, restart server
npm run dev
```

### Issue: Still see old categories
**Solution:**
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check you're looking at diagnostic page (not old results)

### Issue: VI not matching
**Check diagnostic page:**
- If "VI MUMBAI" shows as `mobile_phone_bills` → ✅ Working
- If shows as `other_offline_spends` → ❌ Pattern didn't match

---
