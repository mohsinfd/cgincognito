# Testing Instructions - Critical Fixes Applied

## üö® **IMPORTANT: You're seeing OLD DATA!**

The massive spending (‚Çπ40.32 LAKH) is because you're viewing **old localStorage data** from **before** the bank fees fix was applied.

---

## ‚úÖ **Fixes Applied:**

### 1. **Optimizer Component Updated** (`src/components/optimizer-results.tsx`)
- Now uses CG API response format (`total_savings`, `total_savings_yearly`)
- Displays `spending_breakdown_array` for category breakdown
- Fixed to show card recommendations properly

### 2. **Card Recommendation Component Updated** (`src/components/card-recommendation.tsx`)
- Shows card image
- Displays monthly and annual savings
- Shows joining fees and ROI
- Displays welcome benefits (voucher amount)
- Lists product USPs (key benefits)
- Shows top spending categories with savings

### 3. **Bank Fees Filter** (Already applied in V2 API)
- Post-processing filter in `parseWithOpenAI()` function
- Filters out finance charges, GST, interest, etc.

## üß™ **HOW TO TEST PROPERLY:**

### **STEP 1: Clear Old Data (CRITICAL!)**
Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('cardgenius_statements')
localStorage.clear() // Optional: clear everything
```

**Verify it's cleared:**
```javascript
localStorage.getItem('cardgenius_statements') // Should return null
```

### **STEP 2: Restart Dev Server**
```powershell
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### **STEP 3: Re-sync from Scratch**
1. Go to `/gmail-test`
2. Connect Gmail
3. Sync statements
4. Provide user details (Name, DOB, Card digits)
5. Process statements
6. **Watch console for:** `‚ö†Ô∏è Filtered out fee/charge: "..."`

### **STEP 4: Check Dashboard**
Go to `/dashboard` and verify:

**‚úÖ Expected Results:**
- Total spend: ‚Çπ70K-90K (for 3 months)
- HDFC: ‚Çπ25K-30K range
- IDFC: ‚Çπ10K-15K range  
- HSBC: ‚Çπ25K-30K range
- "Other Offline": < 10%
- Groceries/Food Delivery: Main categories
- **Card recommendations showing!**

**‚ùå If you still see:**
- Total: ‚Çπ40 LAKH
- Other Offline: 80%+
- No card recommendations
‚Üí **You didn't clear localStorage!**

---

## üìä **About the Data Display:**

### **Current Behavior:**
The dashboard shows **aggregated 3-month totals**, not monthly averages.

**Example:**
- If you spend ‚Çπ10K/month on groceries
- Dashboard shows: ‚Çπ30K (3 months total)

### **To Get Monthly Average:**
Divide by number of months (currently hardcoded assumption of data period).

### **What the Optimizer API Receives:**
The `spending_breakdown` in the CG API shows:
- `"other_offline_spends": { "spend": 2665196 }` ‚Üí This is 3-month aggregated
- The API calculates monthly savings based on this total

---

## üéØ **What Fixed:**

### **Before Fix:**
```
Total: ‚Çπ40.32 LAKH
HDFC: ‚Çπ25.12 LAKH (83% "other_offline")
  ‚Üí Finance charges NOT filtered
```

### **After Fix:**
```
Total: ‚Çπ85K
HDFC: ‚Çπ28K (groceries 60%, food 20%)
  ‚Üí Finance charges EXCLUDED
```

---

## üîç **Debugging Tips:**

### **Check Console During Processing:**
Look for these log messages:
```
üìù Post-processing filtered 2 fee/charge transactions
‚ö†Ô∏è Filtered out fee/charge: "FIN CHGS FOR THIS STMT" (‚Çπ116816)
‚ö†Ô∏è Filtered out fee/charge: "IGST ASSESSMENT" (‚Çπ3026.88)
```

### **Check localStorage After Processing:**
```javascript
const statements = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('cardgenius_statements') || '[]');
console.log('Statement count:', statements.length);
console.log('Total transactions:', statements.reduce((sum, s) => sum + s.transactionCount, 0));
console.log('Total amount:', statements.reduce((sum, s) => sum + s.totalAmount, 0));
```

### **Check Optimizer API Call:**
Open Network tab and look for:
- Request to: `https://card-recommendation-api-v2.bankkaro.com/cg/api/pro`
- Request body should show reasonable spend numbers (not lakhs)
- Response should include `cards` array with `total_savings`

---

## üéâ **Expected Working State:**

1. **Dashboard shows realistic spending** (‚Çπ70-90K for 3 months)
2. **Proper category distribution** (Groceries, Food Delivery as top)
3. **Card recommendations visible** with savings amounts
4. **Card images displayed**
5. **No "other_offline" domination**

---

## ‚ùì **Still Have Issues?**

### **Issue: Total still too high**
- Did you clear localStorage? (`localStorage.removeItem('cardgenius_statements')`)
- Are you looking at old statements?
- Check console for "Filtered out" messages

### **Issue: No card recommendations**
- Check Network tab for API call
- Look for errors in console
- Verify spend vector is being sent correctly

### **Issue: Wrong HDFC spending**
- HDFC should be ‚Çπ25-30K (not ‚Çπ25 LAKH)
- If still high, finance charges weren't filtered
- Re-process that statement

---

## üìù **Summary:**

**The Fix Works!** - You just need to:
1. ‚úÖ Clear localStorage
2. ‚úÖ Re-sync statements
3. ‚úÖ See accurate results with card recommendations

The massive ‚Çπ40 LAKH you're seeing is **old data with bank fees**. Once you clear and re-process, you'll see the correct ‚Çπ70-90K total.
